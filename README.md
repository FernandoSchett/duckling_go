## About 🤔:

Duckling GO is a mobile game about capturing pokemons, developed in JAVA using Android Studio by undergraduate students in computer engineering.

Using [API](https://pokeapi.co/) as a database, players can log in every day and receive a different random pokemon. This way, it is possible to collect their favorite monsters!

## Resources 🧑‍🔬:

- Collect random pokemons, with one pokemon per day.
